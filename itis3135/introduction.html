        <h1>Welcome to My Introduction Page</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Caleb "Clever Walrus" Woodworth! I'm a student in ITIS 3135, learning about web development.</p>
        
        <h2>Personal Background:</h2>
        <p>I grew up in Apex, NC attending a smaller Christian private school. I was a big-time soccer player all the way up through high school. Now I enjoy fishing in my free time. I have a younger brother and sister and a dog.</p>

        <h2>Professional Background:</h2>
        <p>I spent a few years in high school refing soccer because I enjoyed being around the game. I have spent my past few summers working as a busboy in a restaurant called Koko Cabana located on Oak Island, NC.</p>

        <h2>Academic Background:</h2>
        <p>I graduated high school from a smaller private school spending a lot of my time focusing on intro computer science courses such as Intro to Python and Java alongside Computer Networking.</p>

        <h2>Primary Computer Platform:</h2>
        <p>mac laptop</p>

        <h2>Courses Iâ€™m Taking, & Why:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ITIS3135 - Web Apps Development:</strong> I want to begin learning about HTML and was also a required class for my concentration in cybersecurity.</li>
            <li><strong>INFO2130 - Intro to Business Computing:</strong> I want to get good at working in excel and was also a required class for my minor in economics.</li>
            <li><strong>ECON2101 - Principles of Economics-Macro:</strong> I want to better understand how economies function on a large scale, including topics like inflation, unemployment, and economic growth, which impact businesses.</li>
            <li><strong>CTCM2530 - Critical Thinking & Communication (History of Photography):</strong> Not exactly a class of interest to me, but am required to take one critical thinking class. This one sounded the most appealing to me.</li>
            <li><strong>ITSC2175 - Logic and Algorithms:</strong> To better understand the structured design and step-by-step procedures used within a class to solve a problem or perform a specific task in programming.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Funny/Interesting Item To Remember Me by:</h2>
        <p>I am almost always wearing a hat.</p>
